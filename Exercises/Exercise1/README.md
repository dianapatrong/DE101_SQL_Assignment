## ✏️ Exercise 1: Design the database model 
Design the Olist e-commerce ER data model (diagram) as is, meaning that you don't have to make modifications, you will 
create the diagram according to the information about the datasets and their columns. You can use [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) 
or [quickdatabasediagrams](https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/) tools to do so. 

Your diagram must include: 
* Tables, their columns and their data types
* PK and FK 
* Relationships (one-to-many, one-to-one, many-to-many)

> NOTE: Export your diagram as an image, name it `sol_exercise1.png` and place it in th `Solutions` folder, 
> if you made any assumptions please also include them as a readme file named `sol_exercise1.md`
