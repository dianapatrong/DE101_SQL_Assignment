## ✏️ Exercise 3: Normalize the data model 
If you take a look at the files we can see that we have scattered data across multiple files, there are repetitive 
columns that ideally should be combined. 

Let's create the normalized data model. You will do a functional dependency analysis for each of the tables and will 
determine if such tables are in breach of the 3rd normal form (remember that the normal forms cascade), if so you will have to normalize them. 

Your diagram must include: 
* Tables, their columns and their data types
* PK and FK 
* Relationships (one-to-many, one-to-one, many-to-many)

Your explanation should include: 
* For each table the normalization process
    * If the tables breach any normal form (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) and why 
    * Solution proposal for that table 
* Any assumptions that you may have made
* Any columns that you may have dropped and the explanation of why 

> NOTE: 
> 1. Export your diagram as an image, name it `sol_exercise3.png` and place it in the `Solutions` folder
> 2. Add a `sol_exercise3.md` file to explain the normalization process you followed
